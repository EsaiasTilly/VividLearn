# VividLearn
Open-source online tutorial website with support for code color-formatting, video tutorials, text guides and more. It's being developed as a school project in the IBDP in CAS as Creativity and Service.

Currently there is not much possible, but this will be updated when such functions are added, incl. a full guide on setting up your own instance.
